        <ul>
            <li>World Wide Web</li>
            <p>This term refers to the interconnectedness of the files which use links to point to one another. Since every file usually points to multiple others, the World 
                Wide Web is represented as a web of links which can all navigate from any one point to any other point.</p>
            <li>Internet</li>
            <p>The term "internet" refers to the physical and wireless connections between computers which send information. Specifically, the term refers to the connections 
                between multiple networks of computers (inter<i>net</i>).</p>
            <li>Browser</li>
            <p>Browsers are the medium by which the internet conveys the World Wide Web to the user. A browser downloads the data that constitutes the WWW via its internet 
                connection and converts the code into a human-readable format.</p>
            <li>CSS</li>
            <p>CSS is an acronym that stands for Cascading Style Sheets. They are a type of file which goes hand-in-hand with HTML. CSS provides a centralized location 
                to contain all of the aesthetic of your HTML documents. This allows you to style a large number of documents without needing to repeat the style code, 
                and allows you to make changes which apply to many different documents at once.</p>
            <li>Search Engine</li>
            <p>A search engine is a website that can accept a query from the user and return results to them pertaining to that query. Most often a search engine will return 
                links to other websites which contain the desired information.</p>
        </ul>
