        <!-- In-depth explanation of the WorldWideWeb browser -->
        <h1>WorldWideWeb</h1>
        <p>The first web browser was originally called WorldWideWeb, and later had its name changed to Nexus. It was released in late 1990 by Tim Berners-Lee, who at the time 
            was a fellow at CERN, having come back to the organization after creating a company called Image Computer Systems and “[running] its technical side for three years” 
            (Grossman). Berners-Lee reports in the Frequently Asked Questions section of his page on W3.org that the reason he wanted to create the WorldWideWeb was because of 
            the staggering diversity of programs one was required to learn if one wanted to access data on other scientists’ computers (Berners-Lee). It was annoying to him to 
            have to understand so many ways to access information when he thought it would be much easier to all have it standardized and in one place. Berners-Lee did this by 
            combining three main technologies which had already been developed, those being Transmission Control Protocol (TCP), the Domain Name System (DNS), and hypertext.</p>
