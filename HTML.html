        <!-- An in-depth explanation of HTML -->
        <h1>HTML</h1>
        <p>The main structure of the web pages making up the World Wide Web is a programming language called HTML, which is short for Hypertext Markup Language. HTML is the only 
            programming language required for making a website, and everything the World Wide Web needs to do to be the WWW is provided for in HTML. For many websites during the 
            infancy of the WWW, HTML was the only thing used to define their structure, and as such all they were was text and images. There were no fancy graphical user 
            interfaces (GUIs) and no cool animations on any of these pages. Modern websites are much more in-depth and impressive because they utilize other programming 
            languages. HTML allows for the user to embed things like Javascript and Python programs to add interactivity to their websites, and it uses another type of file 
            called a Cascading Style Sheet (CSS) to allow for full customization of appearance.</p>
